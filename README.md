This is a 4th-year project exploring physics concepts, with the final exercise involving the creation of a **petanque game** using a **Vulkan engine**.

# VulkanRenderer

## Controls

The controls for the renderer are very basic.

```
Mouse look to rotate the camera around the origin.
Scroll to zoom.
"R" to reset the scene.
"T" to pause and unpause time.
"Y" to step the simulation by a single frame (only works when the simulation is paused).
```
